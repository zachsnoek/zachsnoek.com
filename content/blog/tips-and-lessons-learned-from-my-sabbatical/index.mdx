Last February, I was laid off from my role as a senior software engineer at a Series A startup. After being acquired, the new parent company subsequently laid off the engineering team and most of the remaining staff.

I knew the risks going in, and while we all hoped for a more favorable outcome, I don't regret joining. It was an incredible ride: I learned a ton about startups, experienced immense growth by shipping fast and leading projects, and had the fortunate experience of working with brilliant engineers.

I initially planned to take a couple of weeks off and jump right back into the job market, but I ultimately decided to go all-in on a three-month sabbatical, followed by a two-month job search.

Because I was financially prepared for a loss of income, I didn't spend those five months stressed or worried about funding. Instead, I had a plan and spent that time traveling, learning, and recharging for my next move.

Whether or not you want to take a sabbatical, it's important to be prepared for a job loss, layoff, or other loss of income. To help you get there, I want to share how I built my own safety net and the financial lessons I learned using it for my sabbatical.

## Preparation buys you options

First, why prepare for a loss of income? Because financial readiness buys you options.

If you have, say, a few weeks of living expenses saved, you buy yourself breathing room to adapt without immediate financial panic. You're primarily buying extra time to find your next gig instead of settling for the first one out of necessity.

I'm going to call this level of savings an _emergency fund_. It's cash you can deploy when absolutely needed that temporarily covers your living expenses. (On a practical note, at least three months of expenses saved is a good starting point.)

Once you have an emergency fund, consider leveling up. If you extend your _runway_ by a few months or longer, you buy yourself even more options. For example, you could:

-   Take a bucket list trip you haven't had time for
-   Spend more time with your family or a new child
-   Start the business you've been dreaming about
-   Wait for the right job offer and be picky choosing your next move

As Morgan Housel writes in _The Psychology of Money_:

> Using your money to buy time and options has a lifestyle benefit few luxury goods can compete with.

## How to build your savings

Whether you're building an emergency fund or multiple months of runway, you need a system to build those savings, and the confidence to deploy them when they're needed. This comes down to three steps.

### Know your monthly burn rate

To determine how long your savings will last and how much to set aside, you must first know your _monthly burn rate_: how much it costs to be you each month. You can start by simply tracking your monthly spending manually. Then, formally plan and refine your monthly spending and expenses using a budget.

I recommend using a budgeting tool to track and plan your expenses; my tool of choice is [YNAB](https://ynab.com/referral/?ref=-erOBCVOWv9he5H1&sponsor_name=Zach&utm_source=customer_referral).

### Save in multiples

Once you know your monthly burn rate, decide how many months of expenses you want your savings to cover. Then, set aside a fixed amount each month toward that goal. Ideally, this process should be automatic and there should be a clear timeline for when your goal is fully funded.

In YNAB, you can manage this with [targets](https://support.ynab.com/en_us/how-to-use-targets-rk5kkI9ks), though many budgeting apps offer similar saving features. Alternatively, you can have a portion of your paycheck automatically deposited into a savings account.

### Deploy your cash

When the time comes, use your budgeting method to allocate your savings. Because you've already calculated your burn rate, you'll know exactly how many months of runway you have.

In practice, this should feel just like receiving a paycheck: money arrives and you plan where to spend it. The only difference is that the cash is coming from your savings rather than a job. This should be the easiest step, as you've already built the budgeting muscle while building the fund.

## Takeaways

I've given an overview of the _why_ and _how_ to be prepared, but how did actually relying on savings play out during my sabbatical and job search?

### What went well

#### 1. My estimated burn rate was very accurate

Years of budgeting meant I knew exactly where my money was going. Because I had fine-tuned my monthly expenses, my runway calculations were accurate and reliable. I didn't have to guess how long my savings would last and I could fully trust my system.

#### 2. I was prepared for true expenses

YNAB encourages saving for [true expenses](https://www.ynab.com/blog/the-key-is-to-make-your-finances-boring-heres-how): those irregular, hard-to-predict expenses that often catch people off guard, such as insurance premiums, yearly subscriptions, and home repairs.

Two of my true expenses are car maintenance and car repairs. Each month, I set aside a dedicated amount for inevitable costs like oil changes, new tires, and repairs.

This preparation paid off: near the end of my job search, my car needed major brake work. Because I had been consistently saving, I was able to cover the bill with a dedicated car savings fund instead of jeopardizing my runway.

### What I'm improving for next time

#### 1. Be more conservative with estimates

While I estimated my fixed costs accurately, I underestimated how difficult it would be to slash my discretionary spending overnight. I initially overspent on things like dining out and travel because I couldn't cut my burn rate instantly.

I also realized that cutting out miscellaneous and fun spending entirely is unsustainable. A few weeks in, I added a dedicated "fun" category, which provided some breathing room. Next time, I'll account for more discretionary spending in my runway instead of using a bare-bones survival rate.

#### 2. Isolated and tiered funds

In addition to my emergency fund and sabbatical runway, I had other long-term savings that I _could_ have used for living expenses. I didn't end up using those savings to extend my runway, but I always gave myself the possibility. While using those funds would have been fine, I don't want to sacrifice progress on other goals unless absolutely necessary.

For the next time I'm without steady income for a sustained period, I want to set clear boundaries and better isolate my savings containers. Moreover, I want to be clear about the order in which I deploy my funds.

Here's how I'm thinking about this going forward:

```txt
month ahead => runway => emergency fund => long-term savings
```

### Lessons learned

#### 1. How to be comfortable spending savings

All savings are eventually meant for spending; the only question is when. Before my sabbatical, I struggled with the idea of spending my savings because of the time and effort it took to build, and because I thought I'd feel less financially secure. The transition was a bit uncomfortable at first, but I made it out the other side knowing that the money served a good purpose.

#### 2. The power of being a month ahead

One of YNAB's core ideas is being [a month ahead](https://www.ynab.com/blog/get-a-month-ahead), which means having all your monthly expenses covered by the first day of the month. In other words, using money from the paychecks in your current month to cover your expenses in the next month.

Being a month ahead is useful to me for two reasons:

1. It makes budgeting easier because it doesn't matter on which day bills are paid. On the first of the month, you already have the money available; when a bill is due, you know you can pay it.
2. It acts like a mini emergency fund because you have an additional month of runway built into your budget.

This latter point was important when I got laid off because I wasn't worried about figuring my finances out immediately, and I knew I had at least one month of runway available.

## Conclusion

My sabbatical was a real-world stress test of my system, and I'm happy to report that it held up. Regardless of your situation, it's well worth being financially prepared; it gives you the time and options you need to navigate the unexpected on your own terms.
