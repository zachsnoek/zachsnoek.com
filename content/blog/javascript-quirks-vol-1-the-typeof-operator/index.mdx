JavaScript is a language full of wonderful quirks. In this post, I want to explore a few quirks about the `typeof` operator.

## The `typeof` operator

As a reminder, JavaScript has eight types:

-   Undefined
-   Null
-   Boolean
-   String
-   Number
-   BigInt
-   Symbol
-   Object

JavaScript provides us with a handy `typeof` operator to check the type of a value. It returns a string indicating the type of the operand. For example, checking the type of `0` returns `"number"`:

```js
typeof 0 === 'number'; // true
```

## 1. `typeof null`

For every type in the list above, we’d expect to check a value of the type and get something appropriate back. For example, `typeof false` should return `"boolean"`, and so on:

```js
typeof false === 'boolean'; // true
typeof {} === 'object'; // true
typeof undefined === 'undefined'; // true
```

However, when we check the type of `null`, we see that `null`'s type is apparently not null:

```js
typeof null === 'null'; // false
typeof null === 'object'; // true
```

Because of [a bug](https://2ality.com/2013/10/typeof-null.html) in the first version of JavaScript, `typeof null` returns `'object'` instead of `'null'`. This is confusing because `null` is indeed a primitive value, not an object, and its type is null.

This means two things for the developer:

1. Checking if a value is `null` with `typeof` won’t work; use strict equality instead
2. `typeof === 'object'` checks can unexpectedly accept null values; ensure that the value is also not equal to `null`

## 2. `typeof` functions

Interestingly, `typeof` returns a string that doesn’t correspond to one of the eight types listed above: `"function"`.

```js
typeof (() => {}) === 'function'; // true
```

This is somewhat confusing because there is no function type; a function is just a callable object. However, it can sometimes be useful to differentiate between a function and some other value because function calling has its own syntax. Consider the following contrived example:

```js
function sayWord(word) {
    console.log(typeof word === 'function' ? word() : word);
}

sayWord('Zach');

sayWord(() => 'Computing the string with a function');
```

## 3. `typeof` undeclared variables

How would you check if a variable is undeclared? You might think that you could check to see if its value is `undefined`, but that throws a `ReferenceError`:

```js
zach === undefined; // Uncaught ReferenceError: zach is not defined
```

`typeof` works for this though; it returns `undefined` if the operand is not declared:

```js
typeof zach === 'undefined'; // true
```

So, `typeof` returns `undefined` if the operand’s value is `undefined` or if the operand is undeclared.

## 4. `typeof` in the temporal dead zone

The temporal dead zone (TDZ) exists for variables declared with `let` and `const`. It starts at the beginning of the variable’s enclosing block and ends when it is declared. Accessing a variable in its TDZ throws a `ReferenceError`:

```js
{
    // start of TDZ

    console.log(zach); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'zach' before initialization

    const zach = 'zach'; // end of TDZ
}
```

Similarly, checking the `typeof` a variable in its TDZ throws a `ReferenceError`:

```js
{
    console.log(typeof zach === 'string'); // Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 'zach' before initialization

    const zach = 'zach';
}
```

[Dr. Axel Rauschmayer explains](https://2ality.com/2015/10/why-tdz.html#why-does-typeof-cause-a-referenceerror-for-a-variable-in-the-tdz%3F) that `zach` isn’t undeclared when we try to check its type, it’s uninitialized. Thus, “you should be aware of its existence, but aren’t. Therefore, being warned seems desirable.”

The interesting bit here is that before the addition of block-scoped variables in ES6, `typeof` always returned a string regardless of the operand. Now, it can throw an error in this one case.

You can learn more about `let`, `const`, and the TDZ in [my article about hoisting](https://z7k.io/hoisting).
