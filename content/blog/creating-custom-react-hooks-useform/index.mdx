When working with forms in React, we typically want to have control over the form's state. React makes this easy with the `useState` hook, but there's still a bit of code to write on our end. Take the following simple example:

```jsx
function Form() {
    const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState({
        username: '',
        password: '',
    });

    const { username, password } = formData;

    const handleInputChange = (e) => {
        setFormData({ ...form, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        console.dir(formData);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                name="username"
                value={username}
                onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
            <input
                type="password"
                name="password"
                value={password}
                onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

For one form, this is straightforward and not too taxing on our part. But what if we have lots of forms like this on our site? Re-writing the state management multiple times seems like more work than necessary for us and would probably introduce a lot of mistakes.

Instead, let's convert the state management to a custom hook that we'll call `useForm`.

Let's start by managing our form state in `useForm`. The user should be able to pass in the initial state as a parameter:

```jsx
const useForm = (initialState = {}) => {
    const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState(initialState);

    return { formData };
};
```

It would also be nice to not have to re-write `handleInputChange` either, so let's add that to the hook:

```jsx
const useForm = (initialState = {}) => {
    const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState(initialState);

    const handleInputChange = (e) => {
        setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    return { formData, handleInputChange };
};
```

Great! Now we can just get `handleInputChange` from `useForm` and pass that to our inputs' `onChange`.

This is what our previous example looks like now with `useForm`:

```jsx
function Form() {
    const { formData, handleInputChange } = useForm({
        username: '',
        password: '',
    });

    const { username, password } = formData;

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        console.dir(formData);
    };

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                name="username"
                value={username}
                onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
            <input
                type="password"
                name="password"
                value={password}
                onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

Finally, let's return a `handleSubmit` function from `useForm` so that we can reuse that logic in our forms' `onSubmit`. We'll want to call `e.preventDefault()` to prevent the page from reloading, but it would also be nice if the user could add some custom behavior when the submit handler is called.

<OpenToWork />

Let's add another parameter to `useForm`: an `onSubmit` function that takes in the `formData`. `useForm`'s `handleSubmit` can take care of preventing the default behavior, then call the user's `onSubmit` function and pass it the `formData`.

```jsx
const useForm = (initialState = {}, onSubmit) => {
    const [formData, setFormData] = React.useState(initialState);

    const handleInputChange = (e) => {
        setFormData({ ...formData, [e.target.name]: e.target.value });
    };

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        onSubmit?.(formData);
    };

    return { formData, handleInputChange, handleSubmit };
};
```

Here's the final result with our custom `onSubmit` function passed to `useForm`:

```jsx
function Form() {
    const { formData, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useForm(
        {
            username: '',
            password: '',
        },
        (formData) => console.dir(formData)
    );

    const { username, password } = formData;

    return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <input
                type="text"
                name="username"
                value={username}
                onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
            <input
                type="password"
                name="password"
                value={password}
                onChange={handleInputChange}
            />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}
```

That's it! Thanks to React hooks, we can create nice reusable form data logic that can be used across our app's forms.
