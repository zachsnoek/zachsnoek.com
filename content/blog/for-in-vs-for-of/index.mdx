`for...in` and `for...of` are statements used for iteration. I still get them mixed up (ðŸ˜¬), so this is a quick reference post for future me.

## `for...in`

`for...in` iterates over the enumerable string property names of an object. It includes inherited enumerable properties and excludes [property symbols](https://www.zachsnoek.com/blog/understanding-symbols-in-javascript#:~:text=Symbols%20can%20also%20be%20used%20as%20property%20keys%20in%20objects%3B%20we%20call%20these%20property%20symbols.%20Property%20symbols%20are%20accessed%20via%20bracket%20notation%3A).

```js
const me = Object.create({ firstName: 'Zach', lastName: 'Snoek' });
me.favoriteColor = 'blue';

for (const key in me) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${me[key]}`);
}

/*
"favoriteColor: blue"
"firstName: Zach"
"lastName: Snoek"
*/
```

### `for...in` and arrays

Arrays are just objects whose property names represent indices. However, an array can have non-index properties, which can lead to some confusing behavior with `for...in`:

```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
colors.hello = 'hello';

for (const key in colors) {
    console.log(key);
}

/*
"0"
"1"
"2"
"hello"
*/
```

Additionally, the index properties are returned as strings, which isn't usually helpful when working with arrays. For these reasons, it's best to use `for...of` to iterate over arrays.

## `for...of`

`for...of` iterates over the values returned from an iterable, such as an array, set, or string.

```js
const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
colors.hello = 'hello';

for (const color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}

/*
"red"
"green"
"blue"
*/
```

```js
const string = 'zach';

for (const char of string) {
    console.log(char);
}

/*
"z"
"a"
"c"
"h"
*/
```
