## Introduction

If you develop NPM packages, you may need to use a local version of a package as a dependency of another. For example, say you have two packages, `package-a` and `package-b`, where `package-a` depends on `package-b`. You've made changes to `package-b` and want to test them out in `package-a` without publishing `package-b` to NPM.

[yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc) solves this problem by allowing you to publish your local dependencies to a local store and make them available for use in dependent projects.

Immediately below are quick start instructions for easy reference. If you're interested in what `yalc` commands do under the hood, continue to [How it works](#how-it-works).

## Quick start

Note: `package-a` is the local dependent package and `package-b` is the local dependency package.

**1.** Install `yalc` globally

```text
$ npm i -g yalc
```

**2.** Publish your dependency to the `yalc` store

```text
[package-b] $ yalc publish
```

**3.** Add the `yalc`-stored dependency to your dependent project

```text
[package-a] $ yalc add package-b
```

**3a.** Install the dependencies of the dependency if they aren't already installed

```text
[package-a] $ npm i
```

**4.** After making changes to your dependency, update the package in the store and push the changes to the dependent project

```text
[package-b] $ yalc push
```

**5.** Remove the dependency from the dependent project

```text
[package-a] $ yalc remove package-b
```

## How it works

When using `yalc` to add a local package as a dependency, you first **publish** the dependency to the `yalc` store and **add** it to the dependent project. You can then **update** the dependency and eventually **remove** it from the dependent project.

### Publishing

To add your dependency to the `yalc` store, run `yalc publish`. This will make a copy of the package in the store, which is located at `~/.yalc`. `yalc` will also compute the hash signature of the package's files and store it in the store to verify that the correct version of the package is added to other projects.

### Adding

`yalc add <dependency>` in your dependent project adds the package published in the store to your project. `yalc` will pull the package into the project and place it in `.yalc`, and will update the dependency entry in the project's `package.json` to point to the local copy.

For example, running `yalc add package-b` in `package-a` will create a copy of the dependency at `package-a/.yalc/package-b`. `package-a`'s `package.json` will have a dependency entry for `package-b` that points to `file:./yalc/package-b`.

`yalc add` will also create a `yalc.lock` file in the dependent project that fixes the dependency to the version in the store using the signature created with `yalc publish`.

Note that `yalc` doesn't install dependencies of the local `yalc` package; run `npm i` after adding your dependency if it has any dependencies that are not installed.

### Updating

If you've made changes to your dependency that need to be updated in the dependent project, run `yalc push` in the dependency project. This will publish the updated dependency to the store and update the changes in the dependent project.

Alternatively, you can run `yalc publish` in the dependency and then run `yalc update` in the dependent project.

You'll need to run `npm i` again in the dependent project if the dependencies of the dependency have changed.

### Removing

Once you have no further use for the local dependency in your project, you can remove it with `yalc remove <dependency>`. This will remove the dependency stored in `.yalc` and the `yalc` information in `yalc.lock` and `package.json`.

## Conclusion

`yalc` makes it easy to use locally-developed packages in other projects. It has some other useful options that I didn't mention here; read more about them on the [project's README](https://github.com/wclr/yalc). Hopefully, this helps you get started developing with local packages––good luck!
