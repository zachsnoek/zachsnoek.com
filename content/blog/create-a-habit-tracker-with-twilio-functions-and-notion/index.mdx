Notion is a productivity tool that lets you create documents and build systems such as to-do lists and project management boards. It allows you to create databases, which makes it a good choice for building a habit tracker.

However, it can be hard to interact with Notion databases quickly, especially through their mobile app. One solution is to host a habit tracker in Notion and interact with it via SMS.

In this post, you‚Äôll learn how to build a habit tracker with [Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions) and the [Notion JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js). You‚Äôll mark habits as complete, add new habits, and get a daily summary of your habits by texting a Twilio phone number. Here‚Äôs what the finished project will look like:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you will need:

-   A [Twilio account](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011177133-View-and-Create-New-Accounts-in-Twilio-Console) ‚Äì [sign up for a free Twilio account using this link](https://z7k.io/twilio) and get a $10 credit when you upgrade
-   A [Twilio Phone Number](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Buy-a-Twilio-Phone-Number-from-Console)
-   A [Notion account](https://www.notion.so/signup) and prior experience using Notion databases
-   The [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart#install-twilio-cli) and [Twilio Serverless Toolkit](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/getting-started#install-the-twilio-serverless-toolkit) installed on your machine
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v14 or later installed on your machine
-   A personal phone number
-   A code editor

You should also have some prior experience with JavaScript. In particular, you‚Äôll see [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), and ECMAScript 5 [array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) in the project code.

You can view the [finished project‚Äôs source code on GitHub](https://github.com/zachsnoek/habit-tracker).

## Project overview

This project uses a Notion database to track habits and accesses it via Notion‚Äôs JavaScript SDK. It also uses Twilio Functions to receive incoming SMS messages and TwiML to respond to messages.

The habit tracker accepts three commands via SMS:

-   `log <habit name>`: marks a habit as complete for today‚Äôs date
-   `add <habit name>`: adds a new habit to the database
-   `summary`: lists all habits and indicates which ones have been completed today

Below is an overview of the different services you‚Äôll be using in this tutorial and how they fit into the project. Feel free to skip past this section if you‚Äôre already familiar with them.

### Notion SDK

The [Notion SDK](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js) is a JavaScript client for the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/reference/intro). It provides a simple way of interacting with your Notion workspace and lets you call any of Notion‚Äôs API endpoints. In this tutorial, you‚Äôll use the SDK for common actions such as querying a database, creating a page, and updating a database‚Äôs properties.

### Twilio Functions and TwiML

[Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions) is a serverless environment for Node.js programs and it allows you to quickly host autoscaling and secure code. You‚Äôll get up and running with Twilio Functions using the [Twilio CLI](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart) and the [Serverless Toolkit](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit) which allows you to develop and deploy Functions locally. A Function is a JavaScript function that gets invoked in response to an HTTP request.

_Note: To avoid confusion in this blog post, I will always capitalize **Functions** when referring to Twilio Functions and lowercase **functions** when referring to JavaScript functions._

Your Twilio Phone Number will get configured to call a Function as a webhook when it receives a message; the Function will then parse the command and call the Notion SDK to modify the habit tracker database appropriately.

Lastly, the Function will send a response with [TwiML](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-twilio-markup-language-twiml) (the Twilio Markup Language). TwiML is a set of XML instructions that tells Twilio how to handle incoming SMS messages and voice calls. You‚Äôll use the [Node.js helper library](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/node) that comes with functions to create the TwiML.

_Note: You can learn more about TwiML for Programmable Messaging in the [Programmable Messaging documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/messaging/twiml)._

Now that you have an understanding of the project and the tools you‚Äôll be using, it‚Äôs time to get started!

<OpenToWork />

## Create the habit tracker database in Notion

Instead of creating a habit tracker database from scratch, you‚Äôll start from Notion‚Äôs [habit tracker template](https://www.notion.so/templates/notion-habit-tracker).

First, ensure that you‚Äôre [logged into Notion](https://www.notion.so/login), then click **Duplicate template** on the [template page](https://www.notion.so/templates/notion-habit-tracker) to create a habit tracker database in your Notion workspace.

After duplicating the template, you should see a page with the database:

![](habit-tracker-2.png)

This is a fairly simple database: each date has one entry identified by the **Name** and **Date** properties. Habits are represented by checkbox properties; if a habit is checked, then it‚Äôs been completed for that day, otherwise, it‚Äôs incomplete.

Next, delete all the rows to clean things up. You can select all the rows with the `cmd/ctrl + a` shortcut and delete them with `backspace`. This should leave you with an empty database:

![](habit-tracker-3.png)

For simplicity, you‚Äôll modify the habits so that you‚Äôre left with three: **Exercise**, **Meditate**, and **Journal**. Delete the **‚úçüèºJournaling** and **üì±Screen Time (minutes)** properties by clicking their name and then **Delete property** in the menu that appears:

![](habit-tracker-4.png)

You can rename the remaining three properties by clicking the other property names and editing the title in the same menu. Rename the properties to remove the emojis.

Your cleaned-up database should now look like this:

![](habit-tracker-5.png)

While you‚Äôre on this page, you‚Äôll want to note the database ID, which you‚Äôll need when accessing the database with the SDK. If you‚Äôre not using Notion in a browser, click **Share** in the upper-right of the page, click **Copy link**, then go to the address in your browser.

The 32-character database ID is the part of the URL before the start of any query parameters (if you have [a workspace name configured](https://www.notion.so/help/workspace-settings#change-your-workspace%27s-custom-url), you‚Äôll see that in the URL before the database ID): `https://www.notion.so/<workspace name if configured>/<database ID>`.

## Create the Twilio Serverless project

With your database set up, it‚Äôs time to create your local Twilio Serverless project with the Twilio CLI and Serverless Toolkit. Run the following command to scaffold a project with the name `habit-tracker`:

```bash
twilio serverless:init habit-tracker && cd habit-tracker
```

`serverless:init` creates a file structure that the Serverless Toolkit requires, configuration files, template Functions, and other files needed for your Function. Open the `habit-tracker` directory in your code editor and observe the following structure (some files omitted for brevity):

```text
assets/
functions/
‚îú‚îÄ sms/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ reply.protected.js
node_modules/
.env
.gitignore
.nvmrc
.twilioserverlessrc
package-lock.json
package.json
```

The project items that this tutorial is most concerned with are _assets_, _functions_, and _.env_.

### _assets_

This directory contains static files, such as HTML files and images, that are not functions but should be accessible to Functions. For this project, you‚Äôll add JavaScript modules to this directory that will be `required`ed in a Function. You can learn more about [assets in the documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/general-usage#assets).

### _.env_

Environment variables accessible to Functions at runtime are added to the _.env_ file. You can learn more about the behavior of certain [environment variables in the documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/general-usage#environment-variables).

### _functions_

The _functions_ directory contains Functions ‚Äì JavaScript files that handle incoming HTTP requests.

The path to each function is determined by the directory structure: for example, the _reply.protected.js_ function is available at `/sms/reply`.

_Note: The `protected.js` extension: this means that the Function can only be called by Twilio. A Function with a regular `.js` extension is publicly accessible._

_An asset can also have a `private.js` extension, which makes it a private asset. Private assets are only accessible by Functions; they cannot be accessed publicly_

_You can learn about the [visibility of Functions and Assets in the documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/serverless-api/api/understanding-visibility-public-private-and-protected-functions-and-assets)._

Each Function file exports a `handler` function which gets called when the Function receives a request. The handler receives three arguments: `context`, `event`, and `callback`.

#### context

The `context` object contains information about the current execution environment such as environment variables stored in the _.env_ file.

#### event

This argument has the HTTP GET or POST parameters passed to the Function. This project will use the Function as an SMS webhook, so in this case, `event` also contains data such as the sender‚Äôs phone number and the text content of the SMS.

#### callback

The `callback` function must be called when your code is finished to terminate the execution of the function and emit responses.

You can learn more about the [handler function in the documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions/invocation#handler-method).

## Set up the Notion SDK

Before you can access Notion through the SDK, you need to create a Notion integration and install the JavaScript client locally.

A Notion integration gives your program access to certain capabilities within your workspace. To access pages with the API, pages must be shared with the integration (similar to how you would share a page with another email address).

In this case, you‚Äôll share the habit tracker database that you created earlier with your integration. You‚Äôll then use the integration‚Äôs Internal Integration Token with the SDK to authorize requests.

_Note: You can learn more about [Notion‚Äôs authorization in their documentation](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization)._

### Create the Notion integration

To create an integration for your habit tracker:

1. Navigate to [your Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **New integration**
3. Enter ‚ÄúHabit Tracker‚Äù in the **Name** field
4. Ensure the appropriate workspace is selected for **Associated workspace**
5. For **Content Capabilities**, ensure **Read content**, **Update content**, and **Insert content** are selected
6. Click **Submit**

This should create your integration and take you to the integrations detail page:

![](habit-tracker-6.png)

Next, you‚Äôll need to share your habit tracker with your integration. Navigate back to your database and:

1. Click **Share** in the upper right corner
2. In the text field, search for your ‚ÄúHabit Tracker‚Äù integration and click it
3. Click **Invite**

You should now see your integration appear below:

![](habit-tracker-7.png)

### Set up the Notion SDK

Now you‚Äôll need to install the Notion SDK package. In the root of your project directory, run the following command:

```bash
npm install @notionhq/client --save
```

Lastly, add your integration‚Äôs Internal Integration Token and database ID to your _.env_ file:

```bash
NOTION_AUTH_TOKEN=<Your Internal Integration Token>
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=<Your database ID>
```

## Set up the SMS webhook Function

Next, you‚Äôll add the initial code to your Function; this is the code that responds to an incoming text message. Remove the boilerplate code from _functions/sms/reply.protected.js_ and add the following:

```js
const { Client: NotionClient } = require('@notionhq/client');

exports.handler = async function (context, event, callback) {
    const notionClient = new NotionClient({ auth: context.NOTION_AUTH_TOKEN });
    const databaseId = context.NOTION_DATABASE_ID;

    const twiml = new Twilio.twiml.MessagingResponse();

    const message = event.Body.trim();
    const parts = message.split(' ');
    const command = parts[0].toLowerCase();

    let response;

    switch (command) {
        case 'log':
            const habit = capitalize(parts[1]);

            // TODO: Log habit in DB

            response = `Logged ${habit}. Way to go!`;
            break;
        case 'add':
            const newHabit = capitalize(parts[1]);

            // TODO: Add habit to DB

            response = `Added new habit ${newHabit}`;
            break;
        case 'summary':
            // TODO: Get summary from DB
            const summary = '';

            response = summary;
            break;
        default:
            response = 'Unknown command.';
    }

    twiml.message(response);

    callback(null, twiml);
};

function capitalize(string) {
    return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1).toLowerCase();
}
```

Note that the code has `TODO`'s where you‚Äôll access Notion.

The first thing this code does is import the Notion SDK client. Then, within the `handler` function, it initializes the `NotionClient` with the `NOTION_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable you added in the previous section. The next lines set up the `MessagingResponse` object to build the TwiML response and get the command from the incoming message.

Recall that the habit tracker accepts three commands: `log <habit name>`, `add <habit name>`, and `summary`. The `switch` handles each command, gets the habit name when appropriate, and sets the `response` text.

Finally, the `handler` function sets the TwiML response and terminates the execution of the Function by calling the `callback`.

## Implement the Notion helper functions

Next, you‚Äôll implement the helper functions that the main webhook Function calls in response to a command; these get called where the `TODO`'s are now. Each helper function will correspond to one of our three commands:

-   `logHabit` will log a habit in response to `log <habit name>`
-   `addHabit` will add a habit in response to `add <habit name>`
-   `summary` will return a summary of the current day‚Äôs habits in response to `summary`

First, create a file called _notion.private.js_ in the _assets_ folder for these functions.

### Implement logHabit

Add the following code to _assets/notion.private.js_:

```js
async function logHabit(client, databaseId, habit) {
    const response = await client.databases.query({
        database_id: databaseId,
        filter: {
            property: 'Date',
            date: {
                equals: getTodayAsIsoDate(),
            },
        },
    });

    const hasPageForToday = response.results.length === 1;

    // Updates the existing page for today's date if it exists, otherwise creates a new page
    if (hasPageForToday) {
        const page = response.results[0];

        await client.pages.update({
            page_id: page.id,
            properties: {
                [habit]: {
                    checkbox: true,
                },
            },
        });
    } else {
        const currentDayOfWeek = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
            weekday: 'long',
        }).format(new Date());

        await client.pages.create({
            parent: {
                type: 'database_id',
                database_id: databaseId,
            },
            properties: {
                Name: {
                    title: [
                        {
                            text: {
                                content: currentDayOfWeek,
                            },
                        },
                    ],
                },
                Date: {
                    date: {
                        start: getTodayAsIsoDate(),
                    },
                },
                [habit]: {
                    checkbox: true,
                },
            },
        });
    }
}

function getTodayAsIsoDate() {
    const now = new Date();
    const localizedDate = new Date(
        now.getTime() - now.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000
    );
    return localizedDate.toISOString().split('T')[0];
}

module.exports = {
    logHabit,
};
```

This code first queries the database with `client.database.query` for a page whose `Date` property is equal to the current day. If there is a page for the current day, it calls `client.pages.update` and marks the page‚Äôs checkbox property as true for the `habit` that is passed in.

If there isn‚Äôt a page for the current day, the function creates a new page with `client.pages.create` and sets its `Name` property (i.e., the page‚Äôs title) to the day of the week (e.g., ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù). It also sets the `Date` property to the current date and toggles the checkbox property for the passed in `habit`.

Note that the caller of this function will pass in the Notion `client`, `databaseId`, and `habit`. The first two parameters come from the Function‚Äôs environment variables and the `habit` is retrieved from the message body.

### Implement addHabit

After your `logHabit` implementation, add this `addHabit` function:

```js
// ...

async function addHabit(client, databaseId, habit) {
    await client.databases.update({
        database_id: databaseId,
        properties: {
            [habit]: {
                checkbox: {},
            },
        },
    });
}
```

Then, add `addHabit` to the exports:

```js
module.exports = {
    logHabit,
    addHabit,
};
```

This code calls `client.databases.update` to add a new checkbox property whose name is the value of `habit` to the database. Note that you don‚Äôt need to specify the other existing properties.

### Implement summary

Finally, add the following code after the `addHabit` function:

```js
async function getDailySummary(client, databaseId) {
    const pageForTodayRequest = client.databases.query({
        database_id: databaseId,
        filter: {
            property: 'Date',
            date: {
                equals: getTodayAsIsoDate(),
            },
        },
    });

    const databaseRequest = client.databases.retrieve({
        database_id: databaseId,
    });

    const [pageForTodayResponse, databaseResponse] = await Promise.all([
        pageForTodayRequest,
        databaseRequest,
    ]);

    // Map habit property IDs to their names for easy lookup
    const propertyIdToNameMap = Object.entries(databaseResponse.properties)
        .filter(([name]) => name !== 'Name' && name !== 'Date')
        .reduce((acc, curr) => ({ ...acc, [curr[1].id]: curr[0] }), {});

    const hasPageForToday = pageForTodayResponse.results.length === 1;

    // If there's no page for today's date, return false for all habit properties
    if (!hasPageForToday) {
        const propertyNames = Object.values(propertyIdToNameMap);

        return propertyNames.reduce(
            (acc, curr) => ({
                ...acc,
                [curr]: false,
            }),
            {}
        );
    }

    // Otherwise, get all habit property data and create summary object
    const page = pageForTodayResponse.results[0];
    const propertyIds = Object.keys(propertyIdToNameMap);

    const propertyRequests = propertyIds.map((id) =>
        client.pages.properties.retrieve({
            page_id: page.id,
            property_id: id,
        })
    );

    const propertyResponses = await Promise.all(propertyRequests);
    const stats = propertyResponses.reduce(
        (acc, curr) => ({
            ...acc,
            [propertyIdToNameMap[curr.id]]: curr.checkbox,
        }),
        {}
    );

    return stats;
}
```

Then, add `getDailySummary` to the exports:

```js
module.exports = {
    logHabit,
    addHabit,
    getDailySummary,
};
```

This function returns a habit summary for the current date. It returns an object whose property names are the habit tracker‚Äôs habits and whose values are `true` or `false`.

It first queries the database for an entry for the current date and retrieves the database with `client.databases.retrieve`. The `databaseResponse` is used to map habit property IDs to their names for easy lookup later on.

If there‚Äôs no entry for today, it returns early and creates a summary object with `false` for each habit. If a page for today exists, it gets the habit property information with `client.pages.properties.retrieve` and constructs and returns the summary object.

## Complete the webhook Function implementation

Now that you‚Äôve implemented the Notion helper functions, it‚Äôs time to wire everything together and call them in the Function handler. Replace the `TODO` comments with the appropriate functions in the `switch` statement:

```js
// ...
const assets = Runtime.getAssets();
// notion.private.js is renamed to notion.js by the runtime
const { logHabit, addHabit, getDailySummary } = require(assets['/notion.js']
    .path);

exports.handler = async function (context, event, callback) {
    // ...

    switch (command) {
        case 'log':
            const habit = capitalize(parts[1]);
            await logHabit(notionClient, databaseId, habit);

            response = `Logged ${habit}. Way to go!`;
            break;
        case 'add':
            const newHabit = capitalize(parts[1]);
            await addHabit(notionClient, databaseId, newHabit);

            response = `Added new habit ${newHabit}`;
            break;
        case 'summary':
            const stats = await getDailySummary(notionClient, databaseId);
            const summary = Object.entries(stats)
                .map(
                    ([name, completed]) => `${completed ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå'} ${name}`
                )
                .join('\n');

            response = summary;
            break;
        default:
            response = 'Unknown command.';
    }
    // ...
};
// ...
```

Recall that the _private.js_ extension makes _assets/notion.private.js_ a private asset. The runtime will rename private assets, so you need to `require` the path provided by `Runtime.getAssets()` instead. You can learn more about [importing private assets in the documentation.](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/client#getassets)

## Set up the SMS webhook to call the Function

With the Function fully implemented, it‚Äôs time to set up your Twilio Phone Number‚Äôs webhook to call the Function when a text message is received.

The Serverless Toolkit comes with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), which you‚Äôll use to make your local Function server publicly available to the Internet. Run the following command to start the Function locally with an ngrok connection:

```bash
twilio serverless:start --ngrok=""
```

Once the server starts, copy the ngrok URL for the _/sms/reply_ route listed under `Twilio functions available.`

Next, you‚Äôll specify the ngrok URL as the webhook URL for your Twilio Phone Number. In the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console), navigate to your phone number:

1. Click **Phone Numbers** under the **Develop** tab in the left navigation (if this isn‚Äôt available to you in the navigation, you can go to the [Numbers page using this link](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming))
2. Click **Manage**
3. Click **Active numbers** and select your number
4. Scroll down to the **Messaging** header

Under **A MESSAGE COMES IN**, select **Webhook**, enter the URL, and click **Save**:

![](habit-tracker-8.png)

## Test the habit tracker locally

That‚Äôs it; you‚Äôre ready to go! Try texting your Twilio Phone Number with the following commands:

-   `log exercise`
-   `add read`
-   `summary`

You should see the Notion database updated in real-time in response to the `log` and `add` commands.

## Next steps

With your habit tracker working locally, a good next step is deploying your code to Twilio Functions. You can learn how to [deploy your Twilio Function at Twilio‚Äôs documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/labs/serverless-toolkit/deploying).

A great way to learn is to take a project and modify it or add more features. Here are a few ideas of ways you can extend this project:

-   Allow multi-word habits
-   Respond with a random encouraging message when a habit is logged (e.g., ‚ÄúWay to go!‚Äù, ‚ÄúKeep it up!‚Äù)
-   Add a command to retrieve a weekly habit summary
-   Send a reminder to complete a habit if it hasn‚Äôt been completed by a certain time each day
-   Send a habit summary at the end of the day or a time codified in Notion
-   Allow habit tracking at irregular intervals (e.g., habit x is completed daily and habit y is completed weekly)
-   Reply with a habit‚Äôs streak when it‚Äôs logged (e.g., ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on an x day streak!‚Äù)
-   Add better error handling

## Conclusion

Congrats ‚Äì you‚Äôve built a habit tracker with Twilio Functions and Notion! I hope you‚Äôll use this project to build up a habit or reach a goal. Here‚Äôs a summary of everything you learned:

-   How to create a Twilio Function with the Twilio CLI and Serverless Toolkit
-   How to use the Notion SDK to query, retrieve, create, and update a database; create and update a page, and retrieve a database‚Äôs properties
-   How to receive and respond to incoming SMS messages locally with Twilio Functions and TwiML
