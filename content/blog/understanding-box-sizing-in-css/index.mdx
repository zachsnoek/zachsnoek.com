## Introduction

This is a post in a series about topics covered in Josh Comeau's [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/) course. These posts will be brief, polished versions of my notes, and I'll write about new things I learned or deepen my understanding of something already familiar to me.

In this post, we'll learn about the CSS `box-sizing` property covered in module 1 of the course.

## The box-sizing property

The `box-sizing` property determines how the width and height of an element are calculated. It accepts two values: `content-box` and `border-box`.

## content-box

`content-box` is the default value of `box-sizing`. With this value, `width` and `height` are applied to an element's content box and do not include its padding and border.

Thus, the total width of an element will be the sum of its `width` and any horizontal padding and border. An element's height will be its `height` plus any vertical padding and border.

Take the following example:

<CodePen id={'oNGjaBP'} tabs={['css']} />

The final width and height of the `.box` is 150 pixels: 100 + 2(20) + 2(5).

We can inspect the element in the dev tools to help us visualize this:

![](content-box-demo.avif)

The content area remains 100x100 pixels and the padding and border are added around it.

## border-box

With `box-sizing: border-box;`, the `width` and `height` properties include the size of the element's content area, padding, and border.

Here's what the previous example looks like with `border-box` instead:

<CodePen id={'RwLWepd'} tabs={['css']} />

And this is what the element looks like in the dev tools:

![](border-box-demo.avif)

Notice that the padding and border remain the same size, but the content area is reduced, making the final width and height 100 pixels.

Here are the two examples side-by-side for comparison:

<CodePen id={'abLvRWY'} tabs={['css']} />

## Resetting border-box

Sizing elements with `content-box` is unintuitive because it requires us to subtract or add values to get the desired `width` and `height`. Working with `border-box` is more natural: if we set an element's `width` to `500px` then we know its final width will be 500 pixels.

You can use `border-box` sizing for all elements with the following CSS reset:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

## Test your knowledge

Check your understanding of `box-sizing` by figuring out the width and height of each `.box` in the following snippets.

### #1

```css
.box {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    height: 100px;
    border: 2px dotted;
}
```

What is the total height of this `.box`?

    100 pixels. The content area is reduced to include the border.
</details>

### #2

```css
.box {
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    padding: 10px;
}
```

What is the total width and height of this `.box`?

<details>
    <summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>
    60x60 pixels. The content area does not include the padding, so we add that to
    the width and height.
</details>

### #3

```css
.box {
    box-sizing: content-box;
    width: 30px;
    height: 50px;
    margin: 10px;
    border: 3px dashed;
}
```

What is the content area of this `.box`?

<details>
    <summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>
    30x50 pixels.
</details>

### #4

```css
.box {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 10px;
    padding: 7px;
    border: 1px solid;
}
```

What is the content area of this `.box`?

<details>
    <summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>
    84x84 pixels: 100 - 2(7)- 2(1).
</details>

## Summary

`box-sizing` controls how the width and height of an element are calculated. `content-box` is the default value and `width` and `height` are applied to an element's content area. `border-box` is more intuitive; the content area of an element is reduced to include any padding and border.
