## Overview

If you're new to JavaScript and have experience in a class-based object-oriented language, you might be wondering how you can create custom objects in JavaScript. In this post, you'll learn about constructor functions, which is one method of creating user-defined objects and function similarly to classes.

To fully understand this post, you should be familiar with JavaScript and have a basic understanding of JavaScript functions and objects.

## The `Car` object

We'll be creating a constructor function to create `Car` objects. Here's how an object representing a 1999 Honda Accord might look like if we defined it using object literal syntax:

```javascript
const accord = {
    make: 'Honda',
    model: 'Accord',
    bodyStyle: 'sedan',
    year: '1999',
};

console.log(
    `This ${accord.make} ${accord.model} ${accord.bodyStyle} was built in ${accord.year}.`
);

// Output: "This Honda Accord sedan was built in 1999."
```

If we just have some one-off car object that we need to make, this would be fine. But if you need to represent a lot of different cars, it would be nice to have a way to reuse common `Car` properties. This is where constructor functions come in.

## Creating a constructor function

A constructor function is a function that creates a new object. Creating it is similar to creating any other function in JavaScript: it can have parameters, has a name, and is declared with the `function` keyword. We'll create a `Car` constructor function that takes in the `make`, `model`, `bodyStyle`, and `year` as arguments; here is what it looks like without its body implemented:

```js
function Car(make, model, bodyStyle, year) {
    // TODO: Set properties
}
```

> Note: By convention, constructor functions start with a capital letter (Pascal case) so that we properly initialize them and don't confuse them with non-constructor functions.

We can set the properties of our custom object by defining them on `this`, which will refer to the new object that is created:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, bodyStyle, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.bodyStyle = bodyStyle;
    this.year = year;
}
```

This almost looks like typical class syntax from an object-oriented language, but it's a function––and we're not returning anything. So what's happening here? To understand this, let's look at how we create an instance of our `Car`.

## Creating an instance of Car with `new`

Creating an instance of `Car` is like calling a normal JavaScript function, but we also use the `new` keyword before the function name. You may be familiar with this syntax if you've used a class-based language such as Java or C#. Here's how we create an instance of the same `accord` defined earlier but with our new constructor function:

```javascript
const accord = new Car('Honda', 'Accord', 'sedan', '1999');
```

Now that we know how to create a `Car` object, let's clarify how this is working. When we call a constructor function with `new`, JavaScript will:

-   Create a new, empty object
-   Call the constructor function with the value of `this` pointing to the new object
    -   Thus, the properties specified on `this` in the function will be set on the new object
-   Return the new object

Under the hood, this process looks similar to this:

```javascript
// Create a new object
const obj = {};

// Call Car, with the value of `this` being the new `obj` object
Car.apply(obj, ['Honda', 'Accord', 'sedan', '1999']);

// Return obj
```

## Adding a method

Just having a property for the car's model year probably isn't that interesting. Let's create a method that will return a car's age. To do this, we'll add a `getAge` property on `Car`'s prototype property. It will be a function that returns the age as a number:

```javascript
Car.prototype.getAge = function () {
    return new Date().getFullYear() - this.year;
};
```

<!-- > Note: In a prototype property, the value of `this` in a function will refer to the calling object (i.e., the `Car`, not the prototype). -->

Simply put, properties on an constructor function's prototype property are inherited by every instance. But why can't we just define `getAge` as a property of `Car`? Here's what that looks like:

```javascript
function Car(make, model, bodyStyle, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.bodyStyle = bodyStyle;
    this.year = year;

    this.getAge = function () {
        return new Date().getFullYear() - this.year;
    };
}
```

This is valid and will give you the same behavior. However, this creates a `getAge` function every time a new `Car` is created. By placing the property onto `Car`'s prototype, we can share one reference to the function across all instances. (This is not very useful in our example, but is important to be aware of.)

## Conclusion

Constructor functions in JavaScript allow us to create custom objects. They are declared like other functions, but set properties on `this` and are instantiated with the `new` keyword. We capitalize the function name so that we know it's a constructor function.

Now that you've learned about constructor functions, you might be interested in learning about how inheritance and prototypes work. I will be writing a blog post on this soon and will update this post once it is published. In the meantime, you can read [Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) from MDN.
