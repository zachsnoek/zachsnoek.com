Something I come across working in JavaScript and React projects is the use of two logical NOT operators to coerce a value to its corresponding boolean value. This might look strange or confusing at first, so let's see how it works and why you may (or may not) use it.

## The logical NOT operator (`!`)

In JavaScript, all values are either [truthy or falsy](https://blog.zachsnoek.com/what-are-truthy-and-falsy-in-javascript):

```javascript
let x;

x = 'JavaScript'; // truthy
x = ''; // falsy
x = {}; // truthy
x = 0; // falsy
```

Using the logical NOT operator (`!`), we can convert a truthy value to `false` and a falsy value to `true`:

```javascript
let x;

x = !'JavaScript'; // false
x = !''; // true
x = !{}; // false
x = !0; // true
```

`!` always returns a boolean value: It first converts the truthy or falsy value to its corresponding boolean value (truthy corresponds to `true` and falsy to `false`), then returns the negated boolean. For example, `!{}` first converts `{}` to `true` and then returns the opposite of `true`, which is `false`.

## The double NOT (`!!`)

You might come across a situation where you want to use a non-boolean value as a boolean. A double NOT (`!!`) allows us to succinctly convert a non-boolean value to its corresponding boolean value:

```javascript
let x;

x = !!'JavaScript'; // true
x = !!''; // false
```

With our knowledge of how the logical NOT operator works, we can see how this makes sense. Take `!!"JavaScript"`, for instance:

1. `"JavaScript"` is truthy, so it is converted to `true`
2. The first `!` converts `true` to `false`
3. The second `!` converts `false` to `true`

Note that `!!` is not an operator––it's just two logical NOT operators chained together. In fact, we can use as many `!`s as we like (and make our JavaScript look like it's gone into expletive mode):

```javascript
const x = !!!!!'s***'; // false
```

## Using `!!`

I don't often use `!!`, but I think there are a few instances where it can be useful. Consider a function that performs logic on non-boolean values that we want to ensure returns a boolean value:

```typescript
function isValidUser(user: { name: string; bio: string }) {
    return !!(user.name && user.bio); // ...
}
```

We can also use `!!` as a shortcut for checking if a list has any elements; this is something I often see in React:

```jsx
function FruitDisplay({ fruit }) {
    const hasFruit = !!fruit.length;

    return (
        hasFruit && (
            <>
                <h3>Available fruit:</h3>
                <ul>
                    {fruit.map((f) => (
                        <li>{f}</li>
                    ))}
                </ul>
            </>
        )
    );
}

function App() {
    const fruit = ['apple', 'orange', 'grape'];
    // ...
    return (
        <FruitDisplay fruit={fruit} />
        //...
    );
}
```

However, it's [often argued](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1406618) that `!!` decreases readability and is used in situations that could be refactored to be more explicit. In our previous list length example, I'd argue that checking for `> 0` or `!== 0` is more clear:

```javascript
function FruitDisplay({ fruit }) {
    const hasFruit = fruit.length > 0; // or fruit.length !== 0
    // ...
}
```

And it's worth noting that using the built-in `Boolean` function does the same thing as `!!` and is arguably more readable and easier to understand:

```javascript
let x;

x = !!'' === Boolean(''); // true
x = !!'JavaScript' === Boolean('JavaScript'); // true
```

## Conclusion

The double NOT allows us to convert truthy and falsy values to their corresponding boolean value: truthy values become `true` and falsy values become `false`. It's a concise way to coerce any value to a boolean but can also sacrifice readability.

Do you like to use `!!`? What situations do you find it useful or harmful? Let me know your thoughts!
