## Introduction

This is my first post in a series about topics covered in Josh Comeau's [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/) course. These posts will be brief, polished versions of my notes. I'll write about new things I learned or deepen my understanding of something already familiar to me.

In this post, we'll explore the `em` and `rem` units in CSS, covered in module 0 of the course.

## Ems

An `em` is a unit relative to the `font-size` of the current element. When used for the `font-size` property, an `em` is relative to the `font-size` of the _parent_ element.

For example, if an element has a `font-size` of `16px` and `padding` of `2em`, the element's `padding` will be 32 pixels (16 x 2):

<CodePen id={'VwzPgjG'} tabs={['css']} />

If an element has a `font-size` of `16px` and its child has a `font-size` of `1.5em`, the child's `font-size` will be 24 pixels (16 x 1.5):

<CodePen id={'abypXWE'} tabs={['css']} />

If the element's `font-size` is not set, the closest ancestor with a `font-size` gets used. Note that browsers have a default font size of 16 pixels out of the box, so `1em` is generally equal to 16 pixels.

`em`s are useful when scaling some property with the element's `font-size`. Consider the following `.box` class:

```css
.box {
    width: 3em;
    height: 3em;
    padding: 2em;
}
```

To create small, medium, and large boxes with these same proportions, we can alter the `font-size` of each `.box`:

<CodePen id={'porRGpR'} tabs={['css']} />

### The compounding problem

Because `em`s are relative, the value of an `em` in descendant elements can compound. This can cause unexpected layout changes when a font size change ripples through descendant elements. For instance, if an element has a `font-size` of `2em` and its child has a `font-size` of `1.5em`, the child's font size is 48 pixels (16 x 2 x 1.5):

<CodePen id={'mdMRZjO'} tabs={['css']} />

## Rems

A `rem`, short for "root em," is like an `em`, but its value is relative to the root `<html>` tag. So, if the root `font-size` is 16 pixels, a value of `2rem` is 32 pixels at every level in the DOM:

<CodePen id={'wvqgLLy'} tabs={['css']} />

`rem`s are always relative to the root element, so there isn't an issue with compounding. This makes them more predictable and consistent than `em`s:

<CodePen id={'oNeBrKx'} tabs={['css']} />

We can use `rem`s to scale values globally by only changing the root `font-size`. The following `article` has many font sizes specified in `rem`s, and we can use a media query to change all the sizes by setting the root `font-size`:

<CodePen id={'MWvJNYx'} tabs={['css']} />

## Em and rem a11y benefits

Both `em`s and `rem`s help make our sites more accessible by respecting the user's default font size, set in their browser's settings. Using a fixed unit such as `px` will override this setting, but `em` and `rem` will scale it. This makes `rem`s particularly good for typography because we can scale the user's font size preference globally without `em` interference.

## Summary

`em` and `rem` are relative units. An `em` is generally relative to the current element's `font-size`; when used for the `font-size` property, it's relative to its parent's `font-size`. A `rem` is relative to the root `<html>` element's `font-size`, which is usually 16 pixels. Take caution when using `em`s because of their compounding effect; `rem`s are more predictable and increase accessibility by respecting the user's default font size.
