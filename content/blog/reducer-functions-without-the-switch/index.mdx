`useReducer` is typically used with a Redux-style reducer function. For example, here's a `useCounter` hook written with `useReducer`:

```ts
function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        case 'reset':
            return action.payload;
        default:
            throw new Error('Invalid action type');
    }
}

function useCounter(initialState = 0) {
    const [state, dispatch] = React.useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    // ...
}
```

The `action` parameter contains all the data needed to compute the next state. By convention, the next state is computed with a `switch` statement.

This convention is useful for managing complex state logic, but you're not forced to use it. `useReducer` is just another way of managing state; the reducer function simply accepts the current state (`state`), accepts some new state (`action`), and returns the next state.

I've found that `useReducer` is handy when you have brief or condense logic for computing the next state that depends on the previous state. To demonstrate this, here's a simple example of a `useIncrement` hook written with `useState`:

```ts
function useIncrement() {
    const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

    const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);

    return [count, increment];
}
```

Instead of defining a separate `increment` function, you could use `useReducer` and increment the count in the reducer function:

```ts
function useIncrement() {
    const [count, increment] = React.useReducer((prev) => prev + 1, 0);

    return [count, increment];
}
```

Below are a few examples of more interesting hooks that use `useReducer` without a Redux-style reducer function.

## Example 1: useToggle

This hook is useful for controlling toggle inputs or other UI elements with a boolean state. It simply returns a boolean `isEnabled` value and a `toggle` function to toggle the value.

```ts
interface UseToggleProps {
    initialState?: boolean;
}

function useToggle({ initialState = false }: UseToggleProps = {}) {
    const [isEnabled, toggle] = React.useReducer((x) => !x, initialState);

    return [isEnabled, toggle];
}
```

Here's an example:

<UseToggleDemo />

## Example 2: useSelection

This hook lets you select an item and deselect it by selecting it while it's selected.

```ts
interface UseSelectionProps<T> {
    isEqual?: (prev: T | null, next: T) => boolean;
    initialState?: T | null;
}

function useSelection<T>({
    isEqual = (prev, next) => prev === next,
    initialState = null,
}: UseSelectionProps<T> = {}) {
    const [selection, setSelection] = React.useReducer(
        (prev: T | null, next: T) => (isEqual(prev, next) ? null : next),
        initialState
    );

    return [selection, setSelection];
}
```

Here's an example:

<UseSelectionDemo />

## Example 3: useMultiSelection

This hook extends `useSelection` to allow selecting multiple items. The reducer function is not the most readable and you'd probably want to do this with `useState` or break out the reducer function, but I've included it here anyway.

```ts
interface UseMultiSelectionProps<T> {
    isEqual?: (prev: T, next: T) => boolean;
    initialState?: T[];
}

function useMultiSelection<T>({
    isEqual = (prev, next) => prev === next,
    initialState = [],
}: UseMultiSelectionProps<T> = {}) {
    const [selection, setSelection] = React.useReducer((prev: T[], next: T) => {
        const index = prev.findIndex((x) => isEqual(x, next));
        return index === -1
            ? [...prev, next]
            : prev.filter((_, i) => i !== index);
    }, initialState);

    return [selection, setSelection];
}
```

Here's an example:

<UseMultiSelectionDemo />

## Bonus - Example 4: useForceUpdate

This hook comes from [the official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#is-there-something-like-forceupdate). Calling the `forceUpdate` dispatch function forces a re-render.

```ts
function useForceUpdate() {
    const [ignored, forceUpdate] = React.useReducer((x) => x + 1, 0);

    return [ignored, forceUpdate];
}
```
