Welcome! This is the repository for my [personal website and blog](https://www.zachsnoek.com).

I rebuilt the current version of my site from scratch in 2022, and it allowed me to:

- Learn Next.js and how to use it for SSG
- Solidify my CSS skills
- Create interactive blog posts by using MDX to add React components to posts
- Add dynamic Open Graph preview images to my posts by using Cloudinary

## Tools and technologies used

My site uses the following languages, tools, and technologies:

- Next.js (for SSG)
- TypeScript
- CSS Modules
- Reach UI (for building accessible components)
- MDX (for adding JSX in blog posts)
- Cloudinary (for dynamically generating Open Graph images)
- GoatCounter (for analytics)
- lint-staged and husky (for enforcing Conventional Commits)
- Netlify
- MailChimp

## Running locally

To run locally, run `yarn && yarn dev`.
