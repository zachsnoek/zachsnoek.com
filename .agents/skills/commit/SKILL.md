## What I do

- Generate descriptive commit messages by analyzing git diffs.
- Avoid vague descriptions like "helps with documents", "processes data", or "does stuff with files".
- Follow the conventional-commits format described in `AGENTS.md` for every message.
- After committing, push the branch so the upstream stays in sync.

## When to use

Use when the user asks for help writing commit messages or reviewing staged changes.
